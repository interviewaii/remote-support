# Groq Chat Restored

**I have fixed the routing.**

All text chat messages will now go through **Groq** (using Llama 3) as you requested ("geoq say ana cahye").

1.  **Restart the app** (`npm start`).
2.  Type or speak a message.
3.  Check the logs; it should say "Hybrid Mode: Routing chat to Groq...".
